Link's girlfriend was stolen by his sworn enemy, Ganon. As they fought on a blimp, Ganon defeated Link and Link was thrown off onto an unknown land where he met a magic hat. The hat, Cappy, decided to help Link on his way to fight Ganon once again and reclaim his girlfriend. So Link and Cappy began their search around the world to gain power and hopefully find Ganon. At the moment, Link was so angry about what Ganon did in the past and he shouted at Ganon:"Where is my girfriend?" Ganon turned around and laughing:"She is my wife now, get out here Link."
