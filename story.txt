<<<<<<< HEADLink's girlfriend was stolen by his sworn enemy, Ganon. As they fought on a blimp, Ganon defeated Link and Link was thrown off onto an unknown land where he met a magic hat. The hat, Cappy, decided to help Link on his way to fight Ganon once again and reclaim his girlfriend. So Link and Cappy began their search around the world to gain power and hopefully find Ganon.At the end of the story,people wish that link found his girlfriend and destroy Gannonw. It takes Link and Cappy years to look for his girlfriend but they never give up. Just right before Cappy running out of power, they finally found girlfriend and beat Ganon together.
It was a glorious battle. Link had gathered 120 items of power, but it still almost wasn't enough. Once Link stomped out Ganon, though, the world began to collapse. They had to work together to get out. And so they did. And they lived happily ever after.
